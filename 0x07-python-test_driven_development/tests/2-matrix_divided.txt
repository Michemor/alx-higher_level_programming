``` Module: 2-matrix_divided ```
=================================
How to use the matrix_divided
=================================

The function takes in a matrix as input and divides it by a given
integer passed to it. Both matrix and integer are passed to the function
as arguments.

Usage
=======

	>>> matrix_divided = __import__('2-matrix_divided').matrix_divided
	>>> matrix = [[1,2,3], [4,5,6]]
	>>> matrix_divided(matrix, 3)
	[[0.33, 0.67, 1.0], [1.33, 1.67, 2.0]]

In the case a string is passed as the integer an error is raised

	>>> matrix_divided(matrix, 'a')
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	TypeError: div must be a number

In the case of a list of list containing strings
	>>> names = [["james", "bossie"], ["Michael", "games"]]
	>>> matrix_divided(names, 2)
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

	>>> names = [[1, 2], ["Michael", "games"]]
	>>> matrix_divided(names, 2)
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

In the case div is equal to zero
	>>> matrix = [[1,2,3], [4,5,6]]
	>>> matrix_divided(matrix, 0)
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	ZeroDivisionError: division by zero

In the case the matrixes are of different size
	>>> matrix = [[1,2,3], [4,5,6,7]]
	>>> matrix_divided(matrix, 2)
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	TypeError: Each row of the matrix must have the same size
